# Boosting predictive ability of tropical maize hybrids viagenotype-by-environment interaction under multivariateGBLUP models

Krause, et al. (2020); https://doi.org/10.1002/csc2.20253

This manuscript was published in Crop Science in 2020, and it is the research work I have done for my master's degree at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (2016-2017). After several requests, I decided to share a simplified version of the R code used for the project. This shared script difers from the material & methods presented in the paper as follows:

1. Genomic prediction in multi-environment trial (METs) is performed with a stage-wise model, with weights equal to 1/SE^2.
2. In addition to the 5-fold cross validation (20% of missing hybrids) with 10 replicates, this script automatically performs analysis for 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, and 50% of missing hybrids within environments, with 100 replicates each. Parallel computing was employed. 
3. The first model assumes a compound symetry covariance matrix, and the second a factor analysis (FA). Both includes the genomic relationship (GBLUP model).
4. In the manuscript, we presented a way to include checks and non single-hybrid crosses materials as fixed effects. There is no magic, one just needs to include a dummy variable in the model. In the shared script, I removed those genotypes and I am just considering the 147 single-cross hybrids.
